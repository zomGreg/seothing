SEO Thing
---------

This project is a bad implementation of a bad idea spawned from a bad practice.

Bad Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm just guessing on this one, but I'm probably right.

Bad Idea
~~~~~~~~

Screen scraping is a bad idea. It's fun, but a bad idea. 

For example, for as long as I can remember, I've wanted to buy a package of
double-stuff oreo cookies, scrape (see? scraping again) all the filling out of
them, and then just eat the "stuff" with a little bit of cookie.

This is almost certainly a bad idea.

Bad Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Searching for URL in a long list of search results by hand is a bad practice.
It will lead to errors, boredom, and bad information.

So why do any of this?

Because I sort of dig this kind of thing.

TODO: Explain how this works once it reliably works.
